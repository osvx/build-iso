OS/VX ISO Build Procedures

    This document describes how to build a OS/VX ISO image.

Build ISO

    To build a OS/VX ISO, do the following in the "build-iso" directory.
    NOTE: do not run configure script as it is not ready!

        sudo make iso

    The end results is the following livecd ISO image.

	livecd/osvx-projectx-devel-*.iso

    If you want to make modifications to one or more packages, you will
    need to get the source of the submodule(s) that you want to change,
    make the changes, build the submodules, and then build a new ISO to
    include the new packages. This is discussed in the next section.

Build submodules

    When you do a "make", the build system will build the binary packages
    for all cloned submodules and include them in the ISO (pre-built
    packages from the Vyatta "unstable" package repository will be used
    for the submodules that are not cloned). If you want to work with
    specific submodules, you can use the commands listed below.

    Using make targets

      There are a number of top-level make targets for working with
      submodules. The commands below use submodule "vyatta-cfg" as an
      example.

      To build ".deb" packages for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "debuild -i -b -uc -us -nc"):

        make vyatta-cfg

      To clean the build for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "debuild clean"):

        make clean-vyatta-cfg

      To do a "release" for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "pkg-release -p", i.e., auto-generate everything and no confirmation):

        make release-vyatta-cfg

If you have trouble installing OS/VX, don't despair!

Visit http://www.osvx.net/wiki/community to find links to discussion groups.

For best results when posting your issue, try to be as specific as 
you can about what version of OS/VX and the exact hardware, including any
optional hardware, you are trying to use.

Include a specific description of the failure condition or error message.

We are especially interested in hearing about installation problems.
Generally, installation problems happen to multiple people and you can help us
solve a problem for others who may follow you.  OS/VX is committed to
supporting an ever-increasing set of hardware, and while we can't commit to
supporting everything, we want to understand which hardware is the source of
problems.
